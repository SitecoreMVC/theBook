# Sitecore MVC - the Book

This is the first open source crowdsourced book on Sitecore MVC. It is going to be entirely written using **Markdown** and hosted here on [GitHub](https://github.com/SitecoreMVC/theBook).

After having researched online for good resources on Sitecore MVC, I found that there are bits and pieces of information here and there, some of great quality. This gave me the idea that, working together, the Sitecore community has the potential to be able to create a valuable book about this topic. So I opened the [SitecoreMVC](https://github.com/SitecoreMVC) GitHub account and started tweeting about this idea.

The initial response shows some interest by the Sitecore community on Twitter. In just a few hours from the initial tweet I was able to exchange a few tweets with [Martina Welander](https://twitter.com/mhwelander), who is a Technical Consulting Engineer at Sitecore and who has been focusing primarily on Sitecore MVC. Martina agrees that this project should focus on trying to capture *real life* Sitecore MVC experiences, possibly by showcasing an array of different case studies. Something that, using Martina's words, "only the community can provide [and will] differentiate [this project] from plain docs". Martina's feedback is very important to me, because it confirms that having chosen to use the Github platform (instead of using a more document-oriented platform, such as Wiki) will give us the ability to include code, not just in the body of the pages, but literally as downloadable Visual Studio solution(s).

If you are interested in participating in this project, let's begin by putting together the [Table of Contents](https://github.com/SitecoreMVC/theBook/blob/master/table-of-content.md). Join the discussion: [Building the Table of Contents](https://github.com/SitecoreMVC/theBook/issues/2).

## How to submit content

As clearly explained in one of the [Github Help](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) pages, 

> the **fork & pull model** lets anyone fork an existing repository and push changes to their personal fork without requiring access be granted to the source repository. The changes must then be pulled into the source repository by the project maintainer. This model reduces the amount of friction for new contributors and is popular with open source projects because it allows people to work independently without upfront coordination.

Therefore, submitting a **Pull Request** is going to be the best way to submit your content to the book.
